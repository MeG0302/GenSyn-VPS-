‚ö° STEP-BY-STEP MANUAL INSTALLATION
Follow these steps to install your Gensyn Node manually:

1. Server Update

apt update && apt install -y sudo

 ```
2. Install Required Packages

```
4. Create screen session

```

5. Create tmux session

```bash
```



Now we are moving on to the most important part, which is crucial for maximizing node uptime.
There is a ‚ÄúRAN OUT OF INPUT‚Äù issue on the VPS because the hardware isn‚Äôt powerful enough for AI training.
To address this, we will add a script that will help us maximize the node‚Äôs uptime.
Please follow the steps carefully.

I HAVE MADE A SCRIPT IN ORDER TO FIX THIS PROBLEM


FIRST OF ALL STOP THE NODE BY PRESSING = CTRL+C

1) Script creation
  ```bash
nano restart.sh
```

2) paste this 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
    printf "1\nn\n" | ./gensyn-testnet/gensyn.sh
    echo "Process crashed or stopped. Restarting in 60 seconds..."
    sleep 60
done
```

then CTRL X then Y enter to save it

3) Give permission
```bash
chmod +x restart.sh
```
4) Start
```bash
./restart.sh
```

Now, your script is ready  
and every time your node stops or shut down due to any problem it will restart in 60 sec. no involvemnt is required
